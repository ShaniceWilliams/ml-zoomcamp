# Module 5: Deployment

For this module I completed it in a separate repo to ensure python version isolation. The course work can be found here: [ChurnPredict Project](https://github.com/ShaniceWilliams/mlz-churn-service)

I also completed the homework in a separate repo for the same reason. The homework can be found here: [Homework: Module 5](https://github.com/ShaniceWilliams/5_homework)
